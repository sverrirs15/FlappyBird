# FlappyBird

We were having a really hard time beating our high-score in Flappy Bird. So we made a Reinforcement Learning Agent to play the game for us!

He gets quite good quite fast, his highscore is infinity (Well, not infinity, but we decided that if he could survive 3 hours at the "extra game-speed" he would never die).
